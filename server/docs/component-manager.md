# Component Manager Documentation
Function name: __createComponent__

#### Description

The first thing that this function starts by extracting data from the HTTP request body, which includes the component's name, author, version, type, and description amongst other fields.

Then it generates the _created_date_ in a format that is suitable for MySQL by converting the current date and time.

The it validates the form data by calling the _checkBody_ method to ensure that the data compiles with specified rules, such as checking that _created_date_ is a valid date and the _component_name_, and _component_id_, _component_type_, _version_, and, _type_, along with a description are valid strings.

if validation errors are detected, the function returns a 400 bad request response with the error details.

Then the function constructs an SQL query to insert the component data into a database table named _components_

An asynchronous database insertion operation is initiated using an _await_ promise. The _db.query_ method executes the sql query and insert the component data.

If the insertion is successful, the promise is resolved with results; otherwise, it's rejected with an error.

Then it checks the _affectedRows_ property of the _results_ object to determine if any rows were affected by the database operation. If no rows were affected, a 500 internal server error response is sent. Otherwise a 200 ok response indicates that the component was successfully created.

Error handling is implemented, including catching exceptions that may occur during the database insertion process.

General exceptions that might occur during the entire process are also caught and logged.
